Geeklets
========

A collection of simple geeklets to be used with GeekTool for cool, customizable information on your desktop.

To add one of these scripts as a geeklet copy the contents of one of the files and paste it into a new geeklet
window with type 'shell'.  Eventually I will be packaging these as geeklet downloadables which will auto-install.

Check out the downloadble Geeklets [here](https://github.com/walshie4/Geeklets/tree/master/Downloadable%20Geeklets).

For geeklets which use python I will do my best to make them both version 2 and 3 compatible.
